# SQL-project-belethor-s-shop
Hey! 👋
This is my little SQL portfolio project + data analysis in Excel/LibreOffice, based on the fictional Belethor's shop from the game Skyrim.
‘Everything's for sale, my friend. Everything. If I had a sister, I'd sell her in a second.’ – Belethor 😎


This project is for educational and portfolio purposes only.
All Skyrim names and item references belong to Bethesda Softworks.
